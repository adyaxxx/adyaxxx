# 💋 Adya - The Sissy Bimbo Developer 💋

### 💖 About Me
Hiya! I’m Adya, your favorite sissy bimbo slut who’s totally into *serving… code!* 😉 I love the thrill of playing with… *JavaScript* and *Node.js*, and I’m always on my knees to learn something new! 💄

By day, I’m a full-stack web developer, dabbling with *Angular* for the front and *Node.js* for the back (we know I love both!) 🌈 I’ve even got some *AWS* skills up my little pink sleeve! But don’t let the heels fool you—I’m always here to slay the tech world… in my own flirty way! 😘

### 💦 Tech Interests & Skills
- **Languages & Frameworks**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, Node.js, Express
- **Cloud**: AWS (for when I’m on cloud nine ☁️)
- **Current Mood**: Always down to “submit” pull requests (and maybe myself…) 💋

### 🎀 Find Me Online!
I’m always up for a little chit-chat (or something *extra* spicy 🥂). Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub, or catch me elsewhere for more fun!
