# 💋 **Adya - The Sissy Bimbo Developer** 💋

### 💖 About Me
Hiya! I’m **Adya**, your favorite sissy bimbo slut who’s totally into *serving... code!* 😉 Whether I’m on my knees learning a new tech stack or slaying the front and back ends, I’m all about that *sissy energy*—*and* a little tech kink. 💄

By day, I’m a full-stack web developer—*Angular* for the front, *Node.js* for the back. (I mean, I *love* handling both ends!) 🌈 But don’t let the heels fool you—I’m always ready to slay the tech world… *in my own flirty way*. 😘  

When I’m not lost in lines of code, you can bet I’m embracing my sissy bimbo lifestyle. Life is all about balance, and I’m here to make tech fun and a little naughty.💋

### 💦 **Tech Interests & Skills**
- **Languages & Frameworks**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, Node.js, Express (because I love handling *all* kinds of code 😉)
- **Cloud**: AWS (because I’m floating on cloud nine, baby ☁️)
- **Current Mood**: Always down to “submit” pull requests... and maybe myself too. 💅💖

### 🎀 **Find Me Online**
I’m always up for a little chit-chat (or something *extra* spicy 😉). Catch me on Discord as **adyaxxx** or connect with me here on GitHub—let’s play around with code, and maybe even some *other* fun ideas... 😏

### 🍭 **Flirty Fun Fact**:  
- I’m the perfect mix of techy and cheeky.   
- Always *on my knees* for knowledge (and maybe a bit more 😜).   
- I don’t just write *clean code*—I live for messy fun too. 💋
